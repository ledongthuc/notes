#PURPOSE:  Program to illustrate how functions work
#          This program will compute the value of
#          2^3 + 5^2

#Everything in the main program is stored in registers,
#so the data section doesnâ€™t have anything.

#PURPOSE:  This function is used to compute
#          the value of a number raised to a power.
#INPUT:    First argument - the base number
#          Second argument - the power to raise it to
#
#OUTPUT:   Will give the result as a return value
#
#NOTES:    The power must be 1 or greater
#
#VARIABLES:
#          %ebx - holds the base number
#          %ecx - holds the power
#
#          -4(%ebp) - holds the current result
#
#          %eax is used for temporary storage
#
