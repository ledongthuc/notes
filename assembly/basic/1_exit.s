_start:
  movl $1, %eax
  # this is the linux kernel command
  # number (system call) for exiting
  # a program

  movl $0, %ebx
  # this is the status number we will
  # return to the operating system.
  # Change this around and it will
  # return different things to
  # echo $?

  int $0x80
  # this wakes up the kernel to run
  # the exit command
